### Example 1. - Include preformated code:

To include preformated code use tripple ` or indent the code block with four spaces:

    ```
    print("Hello!")
    ```

```
print("Hello!")
```

By default no syntax highlighting is applied. Add syntax name (eg. programming language name) after the first sequence of ` to activate syntax highlighting:

### Example 2. - Syntax highlighting of Python code:

    ```python
    print("Hello!")
    ```

```python
print("Hello!")
```
